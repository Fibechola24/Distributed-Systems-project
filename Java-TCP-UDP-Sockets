                * What is the role of IO.DataInputStream and IO.DataOutputStream in this interaction
                * Ans:
 *These are Processes used by the server and client to send information to each other.
 *The server uses the OutStream to send information to the client and uses the inputStream to receive information from the client
 *likewise the client sends information to the server using the outputStream and receives data or information from the server using the inputStreamit


                * Is the TCP_Server process alive after answering to a client request?
                * Ans:
 * \No, the server was designed to only answer one client request after that the server closes
 * the server socket and client socket was closed so the tcp server process is no longer alive.
